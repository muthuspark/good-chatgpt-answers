    "text": "Price/Graham Number\nThe Price/Graham Number, also known as the Benjamin Graham Number, is a valuation metric used to assess the intrinsic value of a stock relative to its current market price. It is derived from the criteria outlined by Benjamin Graham in his seminal investment book, “The Intelligent Investor.”\nThe Price/Graham Number is calculated as follows:\nPrice/Graham Number = √(22.5 × EPS × BVPS)\nWhere:\n\nEPS is the company’s earnings per share (EPS) for the past three years, averaged.\nBVPS is the company’s book value per share (BVPS).\n\nAccording to Graham, a stock with a Price/Graham Number of 1.5 or less is considered undervalued, while a stock with a Price/Graham Number above 2.0 is considered overvalued. A Price/Graham Number of 1.86 indicates that the stock is slightly undervalued based on Graham’s criteria.\nIt is important to note that the Price/Graham Number is just one of many factors to consider when evaluating a stock. Other important factors include the company’s growth prospects, financial strength, and competitive landscape."

    "text": "Peter Lynch Ratio\nThe Peter Lynch Ratio, also known as the PEG ratio (Price/Earnings to Growth ratio), is a financial metric used to evaluate a stock’s valuation by taking into account its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio in relation to its earnings growth rate. It’s named after the famous investor Peter Lynch, who popularized this metric.\nThe formula for the Peter Lynch Ratio (PEG ratio) is:\n\\[ \\text{PEG Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{P/E Ratio}}{\\text{Earnings Growth Rate}} \\]\nA PEG ratio below 1 might suggest that a stock is undervalued relative to its expected earnings growth, indicating that the stock’s price might not fully reflect its growth potential. However, what constitutes a “good” range for the PEG ratio can vary depending on the industry, company, and market conditions.\nAs a general guideline:\n\nA PEG ratio less than 1 could indicate that the stock may be undervalued relative to its growth prospects. This might suggest a potentially good investment opportunity.\nA PEG ratio around 1 might imply that the stock’s price is fairly in line with its expected growth rate.\nA PEG ratio above 1 might suggest that the stock is relatively overvalued compared to its earnings growth rate. However, higher growth companies or industries might have higher PEG ratios and still be considered attractive if their growth prospects justify the valuation.\n\nIt’s essential to consider other factors alongside the PEG ratio when evaluating a stock. Market conditions, industry trends, company management, and the overall economic outlook are crucial elements in making investment decisions. The PEG ratio is just one tool among many used by investors to assess a stock’s potential."

    "text": "Sloan Ratio\nThe Sloan Ratio is a financial metric named after Richard Sloan, who discovered that companies with high accruals tend to underperform. The ratio is used to measure the extent to which a company’s earnings are comprised of non-cash components.\nThe formula for the Sloan Ratio is:\n\\[ \\text{Sloan Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Net Income} - \\text{Cash Flow from Operations} - \\text{Depreciation and Amortization}}{\\text{Total Assets}} \\]\nA Sloan Ratio close to 0 suggests that the company’s earnings are primarily composed of cash components, which is generally a positive sign. Conversely, a high absolute Sloan Ratio (either positive or negative) suggests that the company’s earnings are primarily composed of accruals, which could be a red flag.\nIt’s important to note that while the Sloan Ratio can be a useful tool for identifying potential red flags in a company’s financials, it should not be used in isolation. Other factors such as the company’s industry, growth prospects, and overall financial health should also be considered."
