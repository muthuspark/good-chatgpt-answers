# Piotroski F Score

The Piotroski F Score is a financial scoring system developed by Stanford accounting professor Joseph Piotroski. The score is used to determine the strength of a company's financial position. The Piotroski F Score ranges from 0 to 9, with 9 being the best.

The score is calculated based on nine criteria. These criteria are divided into three groups: Profitability, Leverage/Liquidity/Source of Funds, and Operating Efficiency.

Here is the breakdown of the score:

1. Positive net income (1 point)
2. Positive return on assets in the current year (1 point)
3. Positive operating cash flow in the current year (1 point)
4. Cash flow from operations being greater than net Income (quality of earnings) (1 point)
5. Lower ratio of long term debt in the current period, compared to the previous year (decreased leverage) (1 point)
6. Higher current ratio this year compared to the previous year (increased liquidity) (1 point)
7. No new shares were issued in the last year (lack of dilution) (1 point)
8. A higher gross margin compared to the previous year (1 point)
9. A higher asset turnover ratio compared to the previous year (1 point)

Companies with a Piotroski F Score above 7 are considered to be strong. On the other hand, a score of 2 or below is considered weak.
