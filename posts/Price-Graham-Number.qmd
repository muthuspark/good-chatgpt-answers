# Price/Graham Number

The Price/Graham Number, also known as the Benjamin Graham Number, is a valuation metric used to assess the intrinsic value of a stock relative to its current market price. It is derived from the criteria outlined by Benjamin Graham in his seminal investment book, "The Intelligent Investor."

The Price/Graham Number is calculated as follows:

```
Price/Graham Number = √(22.5 × EPS × BVPS)
```

Where:

* **EPS** is the company's earnings per share (EPS) for the past three years, averaged.

* **BVPS** is the company's book value per share (BVPS).

According to Graham, a stock with a Price/Graham Number of 1.5 or less is considered undervalued, while a stock with a Price/Graham Number above 2.0 is considered overvalued. A Price/Graham Number of 1.86 indicates that the stock is slightly undervalued based on Graham's criteria.

It is important to note that the Price/Graham Number is just one of many factors to consider when evaluating a stock. Other important factors include the company's growth prospects, financial strength, and competitive landscape.
