# Altman Z Score

The Altman Z Score is a financial formula that was developed by Edward I. Altman in 1968. It is used to predict the likelihood that a business will go bankrupt within the next two years. The formula takes into account profitability, leverage, liquidity, solvency, and activity ratios to calculate a single score.

The Altman Z Score is calculated as follows:

Z = 1.2A + 1.4B + 3.3C + 0.6D + 1.0E

Where:
- A = Working Capital / Total Assets
- B = Retained Earnings / Total Assets
- C = Earnings Before Interest and Tax / Total Assets
- D = Market Value of Equity / Total Liabilities
- E = Sales / Total Assets

The interpretation of the Altman Z Score is as follows:
- Z > 2.99 - The company is in the 'Safe' Zone
- 1.8 < Z < 2.99 - The company is in the 'Grey' Zone
- Z < 1.8 - The company is in the 'Distress' Zone
